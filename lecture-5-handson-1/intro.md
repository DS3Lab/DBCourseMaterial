# Goal

In this session we are going to dive into more in depth in SQL. To do that, we
will install a popular DBMS (PostgreSQL) and we will start from simple insert
queries and go until queries with nested subqueries that also use the `WITH`
clause.

After this lecture you should be able to undestand:
  * How to create tables in SQL.
  * How to insert values into these tables and some simple restrictions about inserting values.
  * How to read parts of your tables using the SQL `SELECT` clause.
  * How to perform joins on tables and also some join variants.
  * How to execute common SQL aggregations.
  * How to write nested SQL queries and use the `WITH` clause.
